Broad Project Scope

Addinsight is an Intelligent Transport System (ITS) comprising a network of sensors mounted along the road network in the Greater Adelaide metropolitan region that collect floating car data. Addinsight sensors record Media Access Control (MAC) addresses from nearby Bluetooth and Wi-Fi devices, and individual MAC addresses can be tracked across the road network over time. The SA Department of Infrastructure and Transport (DIT) is interested in using this data to recreate vehicle trajectories, estimate the car travel time between different zones and observe route choices made by car drivers.
As a part of this project we were given access to one-year’s worth of raw MAC ID data collected by the Addinsight network of Bluetooth beacons within the Greater Adelaide metropolitan region and we were expected to process this data and create a visualisation tool that allows users to observe travel times and route choices on the Adelaide road network.

Project Outcomes

The primary objective of this project is to create a dashboard that allows users to visualise the following:

•	Mean and median travel times between different Statistical Areas Level 1 (SA1) zones in the region, as well as some measure of dispersion (e.g. variance, percentiles).

•	Frequency of use of different routes between different SA1 zones. 
The dashboard also offers users the option to filter data by time of day, day of the week, month of the year, etc.

-> The Adelaide Road Network (Statistical Analysis).pdf document is a detailed report of all the work that we have done throughout the course of the project.

The analysis that was performed in the project was broken down into smaller sections as follows:
<br /> (i) Finding best possible routes with Google API
<br /> (ii) Time Series Analysis
<br /> (iii) Visualization of routes with Power BI
<br /> (iv) Visualization of routes with Tableau
<br /> (v) Summary Statistics by Sites and SA1 Zones in Tableau
